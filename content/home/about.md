# About me
My research interests center on computational geography for understanding the geospatial complexity in spatial human-urban environment interactions. I focus on geospatial Big Data analytics for studying urban dynamics concerning urban mobility, accessibility, and sustainability. I am keen to incorporate state-of-the-art methodologies into my research, such as advanced data mining and machine learning, geovisual-analytics, and high-performance computing to delineate the spatiotemporal geography with spatial Big Data. 

As a GIScientist, I am interested in understanding different interplay between human activities and the geospatial settings of urban environment. I look into human mobility patterns and its applications for understanding dynamic urban structures, with research questions addressing whether urban mobility is shaped by the underlying urban structure or the real-world human interactions actually delineate the image of a city.
