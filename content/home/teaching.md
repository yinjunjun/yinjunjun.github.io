In terms of teaching interests and experience, I expect to teach fundamental courses in spatial analysis and GIS. In addition, I will deliver more advanced computational geography courses for utilizing (high-performance) computational approaches to solving real-world geospatial processes and problems. A list of courses that I have developed is shown below, including workshops and short courses:

2016 - GEOG 479: Advanced Topics in GIS â€“ CyberGIS, Spring, 2016, Lecturer, Department of Geography and Geographic Information Science, UIUC\\
2015 - Parallel Databases, workshop/short course series, CyberGIS Center, UIUC\\
2015 - Interactive Visualization of Large-scale Movement Data using Apache Spark, Summer school series, CyberGIS Center, UIUC\\
2015 - Introducing the CyberGIS Toolkit in high performance computing environment, workshop/short course series, CyberGIS Center, UIUC\\
2015 - Taming with geospatial Big Data with Hadoop, workshop/short course series, CyberGIS Center, UIUC\\
2014 - Getting to know CyberGIS, workshop/short course series, CyberGIS Center, UIUC
