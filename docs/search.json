    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

Previously, I was an Assistant Research Professor at Penn State’s Social Science Research Institute and Population Research Institute, an Associate at its Institute for Computational and Data Sciences. I also served as a postdoctoral fellow at the CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\nMy research bridges Geographic Information Science (GIScience), Geospatial Data Science, and Computational Social Science, with a focus on tackling complex social and environmental challenges. My research explores the spatiotemporal dynamics of human behavior and urban systems, particularly how geographic contexts influence decision-making and shape patterns of mobility, accessibility, and urban living. By leveraging massive geospatial datasets, including social media posts, remote sensing imagery, and mobility traces, I develop data-driven insights into human-environment interactions in rapidly changing urban environments. My methodological expertise includes spatial data mining, geovisual analytics, and the integration of AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning with geographic data. I also utilize high-performance and distributed computing to enable scalable analysis of geospatial big data.\n\n\n\nGIScience, Geospatial Data Science, Computational Social Science, Spatial Analysis and Modelling, Geo-Complexity, Human Mobility\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdoc in GIScience, 2016, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,\nPh.D in Spatial Information Science, 2013, Dublin Institute of Technology\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistant Research Professor, Social Science Research Institute and Population Research Institute, Pennsylvania State University, 2019 - 2025\nAssociate, Institute for Computational and Data Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, 2018 - 2025\nSocial Science Big Data Research Scientist, Pennsylvania State University, 2016 - 2018\nLecturer, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2016"
